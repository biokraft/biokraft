### Hi there, I'm Se√°n üëã

I'm a Data Scientist who loves to build. My focus is on the intersection of **Software Engineering, System Design, and AI/ML**. I'm passionate about creating tools and workflows that amplify developer productivity and exploring the cutting edge of what's possible, right now.

Currently, I'm channeling this passion in a few key areas:

---

#### üöÄ My Cursor Framework: Supercharge Your AI Productivity
This is my flagship project: the **[My Cursor Framework](https://github.com/biokraft/my-cursor-framework)**. It's a comprehensive guide packed with best practices, reusable rules, and advanced workflows to help you master AI-assisted development with Cursor. I've poured countless hours into this, and I believe it's an essential resource for anyone serious about leveraging AI in their work.

#### üå¶Ô∏è Building for IoT: The Aura Weather Display
I'm also passionate about the world of IoT. I've forked and am actively developing **[Aura](https://github.com/biokraft/Aura)**, a firmware for a DIY smart weather widget that runs on "Cheap Yellow Display" ESP32 devices. It‚Äôs a fun project that combines hardware, C++, and a rich graphical interface with LVGL.
